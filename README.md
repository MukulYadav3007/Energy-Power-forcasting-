# Energy-Power-forcasting-
Power forecasting is a critical aspect of energy management systems, facilitating efficient allocation and utilization of resources in the power grid. This abstract presents the framework and outcomes of a power forecasting project aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of short-term and long-term power predictions.
The project employs a combination of traditional time series analysis techniques and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to forecast power demand and generation. The project focuses on addressing several challenges in power forecasting, including the inherent volatility and non-linearity of power demand and generation patterns.
Key components of the project include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Various machine learning models, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), are explored and compared for their forecasting performance.
In conclusion, the power forecasting project showcases the potential of advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to address the challenges associated with power prediction. By leveraging historical data and advanced modelling approaches.
